# Zeis coudé project for observatory Halley.

OnstepX based project for Zeis coudé.
initial scope of project:
build on an Arduino Giga with touchscreen.
project is running  servo motors with encoders.
both axis have renishaw encoder rings.
needs an RTC.
optional gps
4 end stops
controlled maximum rotation per axis.
uses the onestep user library for fixed position
uses ascom to control Dome via Nina or Stellarium

Current version is the basic Onstep x  first step is to make a pinn map for the Arduino Giga R1
