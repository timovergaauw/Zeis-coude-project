# Zeis coudé project for observatory Halley.

OnstepX based project for Zeis coudé.
initial scope of project:
build on an Arduino Giga with touchscreen.
project is running  servo motors with encoders.
both axis have renishaw encoder rings.
needs an RTC.
optional gps
4 end stops
controlled maximum rotation per axis.
uses the onestep user library for fixed position
uses ascom to control Dome via Nina or Stellarium

Version 1.0 is the first step to make a pinn map for the Arduino Giga R1
version main is the main onstepx from where the project starts this to have a starting point and base file.
